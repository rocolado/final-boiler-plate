# Final project
This is the final project done in Frontend Ironhack Bootcamp.
The project is a duplicate of [TaskApp](https://vue-supabase-todo.vercel.app/auth).

The [TaskApp](https://vue-supabase-todo.vercel.app/auth) allows you to create multiple tasks for the current user that is logged in.  
The main functionalities to implement are "Sing up", "Sign in", "Sign out", "Create task", "Update task" and "Delete task".  
  
## Technologies
***
The project is created with:

* Vue 3
* Vue router
* Pinia
* Vite
* Supabase
* Bootstrap 5

## Project Setup
***
```
npm install
```

**Set Up your Environment Variables from Supabase located at the root folder of the project**
```
VITE_SUPABASE_URL
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY 
```  

Once you have added your environment variables, head to your .gitIgnore file located at the root folder and uncomment the .env file naming to avoid sharing any private access keys to your database.
